## üóÇ JSON Format Example

Here‚Äôs the expected structure for your JSON file:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "question": "What does REST stand for?",
      "answer": "Representational State Transfer",
      "choices": ["Random", "Representational State Transfer", "Stateful"],
      "explanation": "An architectural style for web APIs.",
      "tags": ["web", "apis"]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also load a plain array of question objects without the `items` wrapper.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your `/server` directory with your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
PORT=5050
```

## üß© Developer Notes

- The app uses `compression` middleware for faster JSON responses.
- Large decks are auto-windowed in the jump bar to avoid performance drops.
- Keyboard and scroll behavior are synchronized to keep the active question visible.
